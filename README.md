# Weather Report
It's a simple bot I'm developing that gives me some information about the weather.

Using **Google Api** to get geolocation data
Using **Open Meteo** to get informationa about weather
Also using **Telethon** and **Telegram API**

# How it works
The bot will reply with the informations if you send the name of the city.

# Clone this repository
Running the main.py file it will work.
**REMEMBER** to set the .env file with these variables:
* TOKEN: token of the bot
* API_ID: token from telegram api
* API_HASH: hash from telegram api
* API_GOOGLE: token from google api
